This project requires a localhost MySQL server to run, according to /js/lms_db_connection.js.

Import the database files in /db/ into a new schema (lms_db) to be able to run everything correctly.

Once the database is ready, open a command prompt in this directory, and run this command: node app.js

That command will start the server.

After that, you can visit "http://localhost:3000" in your preferred browser (I designed using Mozilla Firefox).

Let me know at loyoun@iu.edu if there are any errors, and I'll see if I can figure out how to fix them.
